    "##### 1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\" ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Machine learning, as a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), centers around the creation of algorithms and models that empower computer systems to acquire knowledge and enhance performance through experiential learning, without relying on explicit programming. Put simply, it enables computers to learn from data and utilize that learning to make predictions or execute actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, computers primarily operated based on precise instructions for specific tasks. Machine learning, on the other hand, shifts away from explicit programming and leverages extensive datasets to train computers in identifying patterns, making predictions, and resolving intricate problems."

    "##### 3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work ?\n",
    "**Ans:** The data with known response variable values is divided into two parts. The training set is utilized to train the algorithm, allowing the model to learn from the known responses. Subsequently, the trained model is applied to the test set, which contains instances with pre-existing known response variable values. The model then predicts the response variable values based on the patterns learned during training.\n",

We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function. The model makes prediction by using the value of the new instance and the parameters in its function."
